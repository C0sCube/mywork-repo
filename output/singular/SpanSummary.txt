Here’s a summary of the key-value pairs from the printed line:

spans: A list containing the text spans within the line. Each span is a dictionary.

size: 6.0 (font size of the text span).
flags: 0 (font flags, typically for bold, italic, etc.).
font: 'Helvetica' (the font name).
color: -12220216 (the color of the text in integer format, which may be converted to RGB).
ascender: 1.0750000476837158 (the ascender height for the font).
descender: -0.29899999499320984 (the descender height for the font).
text: 'Issuer' (the actual text content of the span).
origin: (258.4020080566406, 138.5396728515625) (the coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box for the text span).
bbox: (258.4020080566406, 132.0896759033203, 274.739990234375, 140.33367919921875) (the bounding box coordinates for the text span, which defines the region occupied by the text: (x0, y0, x1, y1)).
wmode: 0 (the writing mode, typically used to determine whether the text is written horizontally or vertically).

dir: (1.0, 0.0) (the direction of the text. It’s a vector indicating the direction of text flow, where (1.0, 0.0) typically represents left-to-right horizontal text).

bbox: (258.4020080566406, 132.0896759033203, 274.739990234375, 140.33367919921875) (the bounding box for the entire line of text, similar to the span-level bbox).
