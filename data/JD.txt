   That's a solid and well-defined job description ‚Äî you're aiming for a Python Developer role focused on web scraping, data processing, and collaboration with data science teams. Here's a breakdown to help you identify what skills you need, what you may already have, and what to prioritize learning based on your current background as a final-year Computer Engineer with internship experience.

‚úÖ Skills You Likely Already Have (or are on track to):
Python programming: You're already using Python in your current project.

MySQL: You're actively working with MySQL databases.

Git/GitHub: You've pushed code to GitHub, likely using Git.

Basic understanding of JSON/XML: Parsing structured data is common in backend and scraping workflows.

Code quality & documentation: You're building pipelines, logging, and structuring data.

üîç Skills You Need to Build or Strengthen:
üî∏ Core Web Scraping
Scrapy: Learn this Python framework designed specifically for scalable and structured web scraping.

Beautiful Soup & Selenium: Get comfortable with parsing HTML and simulating browser actions.

Handling HTTP/headers/requests: Learn the requests library and how HTTP works (status codes, headers, cookies, etc.).

üî∏ Data Pipeline & Processing
Data cleaning & preprocessing: Use pandas, regex, and normalization techniques.

Large-scale processing (Bonus): Exposure to Kafka, Spark, or Dask can set you apart.

üî∏ Infrastructure & Deployment
Docker: Learn to containerize your Python apps.

Cloud services: Start with AWS basics (EC2, S3, Lambda); or GCP/Azure.

Database scaling: Get familiar with NoSQL like MongoDB along with indexing and querying.

üî∏ Good Practices
Security & privacy in scraping: Understand robots.txt, rate-limiting, IP rotation, and ethical boundaries.

Code reviews & CI/CD tools: Practice submitting PRs and writing testable, modular code.

üöÄ Suggested Roadmap (3‚Äì4 months):
Month 1: Core Scraping Tools

Deep dive into requests, BeautifulSoup, and Scrapy

Practice scraping real-world websites (Amazon, LinkedIn, news)

Learn anti-bot measures & how to ethically bypass them

Month 2: Data Processing + SQL/NoSQL

Practice data cleaning with pandas, regex, and numpy

MongoDB basics: CRUD, indexing, querying

Optimize MySQL queries and schema design

Month 3: DevOps & Deployment

Learn Docker, build and run containers

Explore AWS EC2 & S3, deploy a scraping bot

Set up a cron job or workflow (airflow/celery - bonus)

Month 4: Real-World Project + Extras

Build a full scraping + storage + reporting pipeline

Integrate with a simple ML model (e.g., text classification)

Prepare a GitHub portfolio with README, Dockerfile, and demo

üß† Bonus Soft Skills to Focus On:
Documentation: Write clear, structured README files.

Communication: Explaining your pipeline logic in interviews.

Debugging: Practice tracing and fixing issues with logs & breakpoints.
