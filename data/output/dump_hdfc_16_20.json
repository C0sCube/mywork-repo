(cid:9) No Exit Load is payable if Units are redeemed / switched-out after 1 year from the date of allotment. This scheme has exposure to floating rate instruments and / or interest rate derivatives. The duration of these instruments is linked to the interest rate reset period. The interest rate risk in a floating rate instrument or in a fixed rate instrument hedged with derivatives is likely to be lesser than that in an equivalent maturity fixed rate instrument. Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration. Hence investors are recommended to consider the unadjusted portfolio maturity of the scheme as well and exercise adequate due diligence when deciding to make their investments. Note: @@ Effective close of business hours of June 1, 2018, HDFC Balanced Fund merged with HDFC Premier Multi Cap Fund (HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund after changes in fundamental attributes). As the portfolio characteristics and the broad investment strategy of HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund is similar to that of erstwhile HDFC Balanced Fund, the track record (i.e. since inception date, dividend history, etc) and past performance of erstwhile HDFC Balanced Fund has been considered, in line with SEBI circular on Performance disclosure post consolidation/ merger of scheme dated April 12, 2018. ....Contd on next page 50(cid:9) (cid:9) June 2024 June 2024(cid:9) (cid:9) 49"

Under some market circumstances the volatility may be of an order greater than what may ordinarily be expected considering only its duration.
