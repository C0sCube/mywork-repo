,"Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and"
,"accumulated impairment, if any."
,Freehold land is measured at cost and is not depreciated.
,"Heritage assets, comprising antique vehicles purchased by the Company, are not depreciated as they are considered"
,to have a residual value in excess of cost. Residual values are re-assessed on an annual basis.
,"Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable taxes and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for self-constructed"

,"Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future"

,Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when incurred.
,"Interest cost incurred is capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying assets, based"
,"on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no"

,"At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based"
,on contractual terms and substance of the lease arrangement. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially
,"all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are"
,classified as operating leases.
,Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net
,investment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of
,return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
,Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial
,direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
,asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(B),"The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which"
,have  a  renewal  and/or  purchase  option  in  the  normal  course  of  the  business.  Extension  and  termination  options
,are included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are
,exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement
,whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether it
,is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within its
,control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will continue
,to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2025 and 2052.
,"When measuring lease liability, the Company discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate. The"

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
The recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use. Value in use has been determined based on future
"cash flows, after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates and"
anticipated future economic conditions.
"As at March 31, 2024, the estimated cash flows for a period of five years were developed using internal forecasts, and a"
pre-tax discount rate of 16.22% (March 2023: 14.99%). The cash flows beyond five years have been extrapolated assuming
5% long-term growth rates. The management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would
not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit.

,"crores (GBP 6,500 million) (2023:₹15,246.72 crores (GBP 1,500  million) and therefore no impairment was identified. The"
,increase  in  headroom  has  largely  been  driven  by  the  improved  performance  experienced  over  the  course  of  the  year
,together with the progress made towards implementation of the business strategy. It was further determined that this

,JLR has considered it appropriate to undertake the impairment assessment with reference to the approved business plan

,"JLR recognises that the potential impact of climate risk to areas such as supply chain, operations, and material and compliance"
,costs may result in variations to the timing and amounts of future cash flows. As such climate risk is incorporated into the
,development of our forecast cash flows in the VIU by reference to our climate change risk assessment. These risks are
,principally reflected by the risk adjustments related to the variable profit and volumes which would be most affected by
,"climate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and therefore adversely impacting"
variable profit.,
Key assumptions,
,The assessment of impairment is based on forecasts of future cashflows which are inherently uncertain and are developed
,using informed assumptions such as historical trends and market information. The key assumptions are:
i),the recoverable amount is most sensitive;
ii),involve a significant amount of judgement and estimation; and
iii),drive significant changes to the recoverable amount when flexed under reasonably possible outcomes.
,Variable profit per unit and volumes – The approach to determining the forecast variable profit per unit and volumes
,"is  based  on  consideration  of  historical  performance,  the  order  bank,  profit  optimisation  efforts  and  Group  Cycle  Plan"
,"assumptions, along with the impact of risks on future cashflows discussed above. A small change in either assumption may"
,"have a significant impact to future cashflows and for this reason, as well as the impact of risks associated with supply and"
,"inflationary pressures on variable profit and volumes, the directors consider variable profit per unit and volumes to be"
,"key assumptions. Further, the variable profit per unit and volumes included in the business plan are largely driven by an"
,"updated portfolio, which includes estimates and judgements related to the transition to electrified powertrain, including"
the introduction of new Jaguar.,
,Terminal value capital expenditure – the five year cash flows timing and amount are based on the latest Cycle Plan. The
,terminal value is based on the best estimate of a maintenance level of capital expenditure which has been derived from
,depreciation and amortisation expectations and funding requirements in responses to longer-term industry trends and
,"risks informed by those listed above, which are anticipated in the VIU calculation. Due to the judgement and estimation"
,"involved in the calculation of terminal value capital expenditure, as well as the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to any"
,"change in the value, JLR consider this to be a key assumption."
,Discount rate – the approach to determining the discount rate is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a market
,"participant after tax cost of debt. These inputs are based on a typical build up approach, calculated using country specific"
,premiums without size premium and with an unlevered equity Beta with reference to industry peers. The decrease in the
,year has mainly been driven by a decrease to the country risk premium. The discount rate is regarded as a key assumption
,as it is the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of the CGU primarily due to the level of
,judgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to small changes in the percentage.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
"The VIU assessment  is sensitive to  certain  assumptions, such  as Sales, General  and  Administration  (SG&A) costs which"
"are not considered to be key assumptions, because significant adverse changes are not considered reasonably possible"
"based on the forecasting methodology, where historical performance has been adjusted for expected future cost savings."
"Similarly, certain assumptions which involve greater judgement and estimation, such as growth rate, but for which even"
relatively significant changes have a limited impact on the assessment are not regarded as key assumptions.
Sensitivity to Key Assumptions
"The value of key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are as follows, presented as a % of Gross Vehicle"

,Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through,
,"continuing use, if the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and if the sale is highly probable.",

,costs to sell. Any write-downs on initial classification or subsequent remeasurement are recognised in the consolidated,
statement of profit and loss.,,
22.  Income taxes
(a)  Accounting policy
Income  tax  expense  comprises  current  and  deferred  taxes.  Income  tax  expense  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated
statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit or loss (whether in
"other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or where"
they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the tax effect
is included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based on respective
taxable income of each taxable entity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between
"the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation"
carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity
and for each taxable jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable
"income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry"
forwards and unused tax credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  based  on  the  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  in  the  period
"when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or"
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on
a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-
forwards can be utilised.
"Deferred  tax  liabilities  on  taxable  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in  subsidiaries,  branches  and"
associated companies and interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Company is able to control the
timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Notes:,
1.,"During  the  year  ended  March  31,  2024,  the  Company  recognised  Deferred  Tax  Assets  of  ₹1,248.90  crores,"
,respectively  on  previously  unrecognized  business  losses  based  on  the  probability  of  sufficient  taxable  profit
,in  future  periods  against  which  such  business  losses  will  be  set  off.  The  Company  utilised  deferred  tax  asset
,"previously  created  on  the  unabsorbed  depreciation  and  capital  loss  during  the  year  ended  March  31,  2023"
,against the profit on sale of investments in a subsidiary company and other income during the year ended March
,"31, 2024 amounting to ₹1,029.20 crores, respectively."
2.,"During  the  previous  year  ended  March  31,  2023,  the  Company  recognised  Deferred  Tax  Assets  of  ₹1,615.42"
,crores on previously unrecognised unused unabsorbed depreciation and long term capital losses based on the
,probability of sufficient taxable profit in future periods.
3.,"During the year ended March 31, 2024, JLR has recognised deferred tax assets of ₹7,093.77 crores (£ 659 million)"
,in relation to unused tax losses on the basis that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
,which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The key assumptions to which the forecasts of
,"the probable level of future taxable profits are most sensitive are wholesale volumes, variable profit per unit"
,and investment.
4.,"In previous years, JLR reviewed tax assets and concluded that it was not probable that future taxable profits"
,"would be available against which the assets could be utilised, and accordingly had not recognised a net deferred"
,tax asset in respect of those assets. In making this assessment in previous periods it was considered that JLR
,"had consistently generated taxable losses in recent years, was continuing to generate taxable losses in the then"
,current period and was forecast to generate some taxable income in future periods that may not have been
,"sufficient to utilise the related tax assets. During the year ended March 31, 2024 there has been a significant"
,improvement in performance. Sufficient taxable profits are forecast to be generated within the 5-year detailed
,business plan to utilise all of the net deferred tax asset prior to consideration of restrictions on the amount of
,UK tax losses and UK tax depreciation that can be offset against UK taxable profits each year. As a result of these
,UK tax rules the recoverability of all of the net UK deferred tax asset will continue beyond our 5-year detailed
,business plan. The forecasts are based on the Company’s impairment model. The sensitivity analysis applied
,to the impairment model as described in does not impact the ability to recover the UK deferred tax asset in
,full. When the tax assets are utilised in future years it is expected that the impact will be recorded within the
,underlying tax charge for that year to match with the similar classification of the corresponding taxable profits
,of that year.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
"goodwill and recall complaints The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being"
typically up to six years and for batteries in Electric Vehicles warranty period is typically up to eight years. The Company
also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle fault is proven to be a
supplier’s fault.
"Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier,"
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on balance sheet date. Supplier
reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset.
Restructuring provision
The restructuring provision includes amounts for third party obligations arising from Group restructuring programmes.
This  includes  amounts  payable  to  employees  following  the  announcement  of  the  Group’s  Reimagine  strategy  in
the  year  ending  31  March  2021  as  well  as  other  Group  restructuring  programmes.  Amounts  are  also  included  in
relation to legal and constructive obligations made to third parties in connection with cancellations under the Group’s
Reimagine strategy.
The estimated liability for restructuring activities is recognised when the Group has reason to believe there is a legal
or constructive obligation arising from restructuring actions taken.
The  amount  provided  at  the  reporting  date  is  calculated  based  on  currently  available  facts  and  certain  estimates
for those obligations. These estimates are established using historical experience based on the settlement costs for
"similar liabilities, with proxies being used where no direct comparison exists."
The amounts and timing of outflows will vary as and when restructuring obligations are progressed with third parties
Third party claims and obligations
A provision is maintained in respect of legal and constructive obligations to third parties. This includes claims and
"obligations related to supplier claims, motor accident claims, consumer complaints, retailer terminations, employment"
cases and personal injury claims. The decrease in the period is driven predominantly by supplier claims as a result of
ongoing negotiations and lower levels of new claims.
"The provision recognised is based on previous experience, which is considered as a reasonable assumption to estimate"
"the final settlement, if any, at the time of the claim. The timing and amount of outflows will vary with decreasing"
uncertainty from the point at which each claim is received to when it is subsequently settled.
Emissions compliance
The Group maintains a provision for non compliance with legal emissions requirements for certain jurisdictions. The
measurement of the provision considers the sales volume in that jurisdiction and the fee or cost per the applicable
"legislation. The Group aims to mitigate non-compliance risk by purchasing emission credits, participating in emission"
"pools or, subject to the terms of the relevant legislation, generating credits by producing and selling compliant vehicles"
in the future. The measurement of the provision at the balance sheet date does not include the impact of credits
forecast to be generated in the future via the production and sale of compliant vehicles.
The timing of outflows will vary and is not known with certainty.

,"When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty,"
,such services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the
,"standard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance"
,service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract
,liability  until  the  service  obligation  has  been  met.  The  price  that  is  regularly  charged  for  an  item  when  sold
,"separately  is  the  best  evidence  of  its  standalone  selling  price.  In  the  absence  of  such  evidence,  the  primary"
,"method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company"
,estimates  the  cost  of  satisfying  the  performance  obligation  and  then  adds  an  appropriate  margin  based  on
,similar services.
,The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points
,on the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim
,discounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points
,granted to customers is recognized as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers
,redeem their reward points.
,"Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time, any amount"
,received  in  advance  is  recorded  as  contract  liability  and  recognized  as  revenue  when  service  is  rendered  to
,customers. Refer note 33(a) for ongoing performance obligation. Any amount of income accrued but not billed
,to customers in respect of such contracts is recorded as a contract asset. Such contract assets are transferred to
,Trade receivables on actual billing to customers.
,Refund liabilities comprise of obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.
,"Vehicle  sales  do  not  typically  include  allowances  for  returns  or  refunds,  although  in  some  markets  there  is"
,legislative requirement for the Company as an automotive manufacturer to repurchase or reacquire a vehicle if
,quality issues arise that have been remedied a number of times and where the owner no longer wishes to own
,the vehicle as a result.
,Proceeds from sale of vehicles for which the Company or any of its subsidiaries have retained buy back obligation
,in future is recorded as a liability – (i) Proceeds received in excess of agreed buy back price is recognized as

35. Other income
(a)  Accounting policy
Other  income  includes  export  and  other  recurring  and  non-recurring  incentives  from  Government  (referred  as
“incentives”).
Government  grants  are  recognised  when  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the  Company  will  comply  with  the
relevant conditions and the grant will be received.
"Government grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, either on a systematic basis when"
"the Company recognizes, as expenses, the related costs that the grants are intended to compensate or, immediately if"
the costs have already been incurred. Government grants related to assets are deferred and amortised over the useful
"life of the asset. Government grants related to income are presented as an offset against the related expenditure,"
and government grants that are awarded as incentives with no ongoing performance obligations to the Company are
recognised as income in the period in which the grant is received.

valuations. The plans with a surplus position at the year-end have been limited to the maximum economic benefit
available from unconditional rights to refund from the scheme or reduction in future contributions. Where the
subsidiary group is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the pension plan above the accounting

Asset volatility
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to corporate bond yields; if plan assets
"under  perform  compared  to  the  corporate  bonds  discount  rate,  this  will  create  or  increase  a  deficit.  The  defined"
"benefit plans hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds"
in the long-term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
"As the plans mature, the Company intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that"
better match the liabilities.
"However,  the  Company  believes  that  due  to  the  long-term  nature  of  the  plan  liabilities  and  the  strength  of  the"
"supporting group, a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the Company’s long"
term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.

43. Financial instruments,,,,,,,,,
,(A)  Accounting policy,,,,,,,,
(i),Recognition,,,,,,,,
,,A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or,,,,,,,
,,equity instrument of another entity. Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when,,,,,,,
,,they are originated. All other financial instruments are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party,,,,,,,
,,to the contractual provisions of the instrument.,,,,,,,
,Initial measurement,,,,,,,,
,,Financial  instruments  are  initially  recognised  at  its  fair  value.  Transaction  costs  directly  attributable  to  the,,,,,,,
,,"acquisition  or  issue  of  financial  instruments  are  recognised  in  determining  the  carrying  amount,  if  it  is  not",,,,,,,
,,"classified  as  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  However,  trade  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a  significant",,,,,,,
,,financing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair,,,,,,,
,,value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss,,,,,,,
,,"Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.",,,,,,,
,,Classification and measurement – financial assets,,,,,,,
,,Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the,,,,,,,
,,characteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and,,,,,,,
,,past pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when,,,,,,,
,,determining  whether  their  cash  flows  are  solely  payment  of  principal  and  interest.  The  Company  reclassifies,,,,,,,
,,financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.,,,,,,,
,,Financial assets are classified into three categories,,,,,,,
,,Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates,,,,,,,
,,to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held,,,,,,,
,,within a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows,,,,,,,
,,"are classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest",,,,,,,
,,method less any impairment losses.,,,,,,,
,,Equity  investments  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (Equity  instruments):  These  include,,,,,,,
,,financial  assets  that  are  equity  instruments  and  are  designated  as  such  upon  initial  recognition  irrevocably.,,,,,,,
,,"Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other comprehensive",,,,,,,
,,"income, net of applicable income taxes.",,,,,,,
,,Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the consolidated statement of Profit and Loss when,,,,,,,
,,the right to receive payment has been established.,,,,,,,
,"When 
the  equity",investment,"is  derecognised,",the  cumulative  gain  or,loss,in  equity,is,transferred,to
,retained earnings.,,,,,,,,
,,Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Debt instruments): Financial assets having,,,,,,,
,,"contractual  terms  that  give  rise  on  specified  dates,  to  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and",,,,,,,
,,interest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such,,,,,,,
,,"assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial asset, are classified in this",,,,,,,
,,"category. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses being recognised in",,,,,,,
,,"other comprehensive income apart from any expected credit losses or foreign exchange gains or losses, which",,,,,,,
,are recognised in profit or loss.,,,,,,,,
,,Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit,,,,,,,
,,and loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial,,,,,,,
,,recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair,,,,,,,
,,value through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.,,,,,,,
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements,
,Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:
,Financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  measured  at  amortised  cost  or  FVTPL.  A  financial  liability  is  classified  as
,"at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition."
,"Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense,"
,are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
,effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or
,loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
,"Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured"
,"at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognized less, the cumulative"
,amount of income recognized.
,Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
,Equity instruments:
,An  equity  instrument  is  any  contract  that  evidences  residual  interests  in  the  assets  of  the  Company  after
,"deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,"
,net of direct issue costs.
(ii),Determination of fair value
,Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
,"between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or"
,estimated using another valuation technique.
,The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the
,consideration given or received).
,"In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset"
,or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability
,at the measurement date.
,"Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted"
,in  active  markets  using  the  quoted  bid  prices  (financial  assets  held)  or  quoted  ask  prices  (financial  liabilities
,held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow
,method and other valuation methods
,(iii)  Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
,The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
,expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to
,another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
,"and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an"
,associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards
,"of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also"
,recognises  a  collateralised  borrowing  for  the  proceeds  received.  Any  gain  or  loss  arising  on  derecognition  is
,"recognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity"
,is transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value
,"through other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained"
,earnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company
,reviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are
,written off could still be subject to enforcement activities.
,"Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged,"
,cancelled or has expired.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements,
(iv),Impairment of financial assets:
,The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised
,cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are forward looking and are
,"measured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time"
,value  of  money  (values  are  discounted  using  the  applicable  effective  interest  rate)  and  uses  reasonable  and
,supportable information.
(v)  Hedge accounting,
,The  Company  uses  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  its  risks  associated  with  foreign  currency
,fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts
,in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest
,rate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e.
,when interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates.
,"Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair"
,"value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss."
,"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging"
,"instrument  and  the  hedged  item,  including  whether  changes  in  the  cash  flows  of  the  hedging  instrument  are"
,expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management
,objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value
,of  foreign  exchange  options  in  the  hedging  relationship.  The  Company  designates  amounts  excluding  foreign
,currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency
,interest  rate  swaps.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivative  contracts  that  are  designated  and  effective  as
,hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income
,"(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss."
,Amounts  accumulated  in  equity  are  reclassified  to  the  consolidated  statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  or  Balance
,Sheet in the periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.
,"For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are"
,treated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other
,comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.
,Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate
,risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.
,"Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or"
,no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated
,statement  of  profit  and  loss  in  the  periods  in  which  the  forecast  transactions  affect  profit  or  loss  or  as  an
,adjustment to a non-financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These
,deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example
,"through cost of goods sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument"

Fair Value Hierarchy
The  following  table  provides  an  analysis  of  financial  instruments  that  are  measured  subsequent  to  initial
"recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below."
Quoted  prices  in  an  active  market  (Level  1):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial  instruments  that  are
measured  by  reference  to  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities.  This
"category consists quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments."
Valuation  techniques  with  observable  inputs  (Level  2):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial  assets  and
"liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the"
"asset  or  liability,  either  directly  (i.e;  as  prices)  or  indirectly  (i.e;  derived  from  prices).  This  level  of  hierarchy"
includes Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.
Valuation  techniques  with  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial
assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
"Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither"
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based
on  available  market  data.  The  main  items  in  this  category  are  investments  in  certain  unquoted  debentures
and equity.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
The fair value of  finance  receivables  has  been estimated by  discounting  expected  cash flows using rates at
which loans of similar credit quality and maturity would  be  made and  internal  assumptions  such as  expected
"credit  losses  and  estimated  collateral  value  for  repossessed  vehicles  as  at  March  31,  2024  and  2023.  Since"
"significant unobservable  inputs  are  applied in measuring the fair value, finance receivables are classified in"
Level 3.
The fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price
"and  for other borrowings the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount"
"rate  equivalent  to    the  risk-free  rate  of  return,  adjusted  for  the  credit  spread  considered  by  the  lenders  for"
instruments of similar maturity and credit quality.
"Management uses its best judgment in  estimating the  fair value  of  its  financial  instruments.  However,  there"
"are  inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the"
fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could
"have  realized  or  paid    in  sale    transactions    as  of  respective  dates.  As  such,  the  fair    value    of    the    financial"
instruments  subsequent  to  the  respective  reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at
each period end.
Offsetting
Certain  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  subject  to  offsetting  where  there  is  currently  a  legally
"enforceable right to set off recognized amounts and the Company intends to either settle on a net basis, or to"
"realise the asset and settle the liability, simultaneously."
"Certain derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to master netting arrangements, whereby in"
"the case of insolvency, derivative financial assets and financial liabilities with the same countries will be settled"
on a net basis.

(c)   Cash flow hedges
"As at March 31, 2024, the Company have a number of financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship."
"The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  use  both  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts,  cross  currency"
interest  rate  swaps  and  other  currency  options  to  hedge  changes  in  future  cash  flows  as  a  result  of  foreign
currency and interest rate risk arising from forecasted sales and purchases and repayment of foreign currency
bonds. The Company and its subsidiaries have also designated some of its U.S. dollar denominated bonds as
hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship to hedge the changes in future cash flows as a result of
foreign currency risk arising from future anticipated sales.
"The Company also have a number of foreign currency options and other currency options, which are entered into"
as an economic hedge of the financial risks of the Company. These contracts do not meet the hedge accounting
"criteria of Ind AS 109, hence the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognised in the consolidated"
statement of Profit and Loss.
Options  are  designated  on  spot  discounted  basis.  The  time  value  of  options  are  identified  as  cost  of  hedge.
Changes in the time value of options are recognised in Cost of Hedge reserve to the extent they relate to the
hedged  item.  Changes  in  the  spot  intrinsic  value  of  options  is  recognized  in  Hedge  reserve.  Changes  in  fair
value arising from own and counterparty credit risk in options and forward exchange contracts are considered
ineffective in the hedge relationship and thus the change in fair value of options and forward exchange contracts
attributable to changes in credit spread are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Cross
currency basis spread was historically included in the hedging relationship. Any ineffectiveness arising out of
cross  currency  basis  spread  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss  as  it  arises.  Cross
currency basis spread arising from forward exchange contracts entered after 1st January 2018 is identified as cost
of hedge and accordingly changes in fair value attributable to this is recognized in cost of hedge reserve to the
extent they relate to the hedged item.
"Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative and bonds, to the extent determined to be an effective hedge,"
is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognized
in consolidated statement of Profit and Loss. The fair value gain/losses recorded in Hedge reserve and Cost of
Hedge reserve is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transactions
affects profit or loss. The accumulated gain/losses in hedge reserve and cost of hedge reserve are expected to
"be recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss during the years ending March 31, 2025 to 2027."
"It is anticipated that the hedged sales will take place over the next one to five years, at which time the amount"
deferred in equity will be reclassified to revenue in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
"It is anticipated that the hedged purchases will take place over the next one to five years, at which time the"
amount deferred in equity will be included in the carrying amount of the raw materials. On sale of the finished
"product, the amount previously deferred in equity and subsequently recognised in inventory will be reclassified"
"to raw materials, components, and consumables in the consolidated statement of profit or loss."

,,against the respective functional currencies of Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries.,
,,"The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments",
,,"primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Furthermore, any movement in the",
,,functional  currencies  of  the  various  operations  of  the  Company  against  major  foreign  currencies,

,,Any  weakening  of  the  functional  currency  may  impact  the  Company’s  cost  of  imports  and  cost  of,

,,"not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of"
,,"assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other"
,types of assets may change with a lag.,
,,The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield
,,curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been
,,calculated  based  on  risk  exposures  outstanding  as  at  that  date.  The  period  end  balances  are  not
,necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.,
,"This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.",
,,The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge some of its exposure to interest rate
,,arising from variable rate foreign currency denominated debt. The Company also uses cross currency
,,interest rate swaps to convert some of its foreign currency denominated fixed rate debt to floating
,rate debt.,

(c),Equity price risk:
,Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price  of the  investments in equity
,securities.
,The fair  value of  some of  the Company’s  investments  in  equity securities  exposes  the Company to
,"equity price risks. In general, these securities are not held for trading purposes. These investments are"
,subject to changes in the market price of securities.
,The fair value of some of the Company’s investment in quoted equity securities measured at FVTOCI
,"as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, was ₹961.14 crores and ₹643.31 crores, respectively. A 10% change"
,"in prices of these securities held as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, would result in a pre-tax impact of"
,"₹96.11 crores and ₹64.33 crores on equity, respectively."

,"₹96.11 crores and ₹64.33 crores on equity, respectively."
(ii),Credit Risk
,Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counter-party failure to repay or service debt according to
,the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of
,deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.
,"Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments in"
,"debt instruments, trade receivables, finance receivables, loans and derivative financial instruments. The"
,Company strives to promptly identify and reduce concerns about collection due to a deterioration in the
,financial conditions and others of its main counterparties by regularly monitoring their situation based on
,their financial condition.

(a)   Accounting policy
Lessee:
"At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contain a lease. A contract is, or contains,"
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
"consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company"
assesses whether:

,a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
,"consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company"
assesses whether:,
•,"The contract involves the use of an identified asset –this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be"
,physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a
,"substantive substation right, then the asset is not identified;"
•,The Company has the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the
,period of use; and
•,The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company has this right when it has the decision
,making  rights  that  are  most  relevant  to  changing  how  and  for  what  purposes  the asset  is  used.  In  rare cases
,"where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Company has the"
,right to direct the use of the asset if either:
Notes forming part of Financial Statements,
,Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net
,investment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of
,return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
,Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial
,direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased
,asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(b),"The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which"
,have  a  renewal  and/or  purchase  option  in  the  normal  course  of  the  business.  Extension  and  termination  options
,are included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are
,exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement
,whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether
,it is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within
,its control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will
,continue to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2025 and 2034.
,The weighted average rate applied is 8.57% (2023: 8.08%).

27.  Provisions
(a)   Accounting policy
"A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation"
"that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the"
"obligation.  When  the  effect  of  the  time  value  of  money  ismaterial,  provisions  are  determined  by  discounting  the"
expected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the liability.
Product warranty expenses
The estimated liability for product warranties is recognised when products are sold or when new warranty programmes
"are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost"
"of  warranty  claims  and  management  estimates  regarding  possible  future  warranty  claims,  customer  goodwill  and"
"recall complaints. The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being typically up to"
six years. The Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle
fault is proven to be a supplier’s fault.
"Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier,"
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on Balance Sheet date. Supplier
reimbursements are recognised as separate asset.
28. Income taxes
(a)   Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of
Profit  and  Loss  except  when  they  relate  to  items  that  are  recognised  outside  of  profit  and  loss  (whether  in  other
"comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity),  in  which  case  tax  is  also  recognised  outside  profit  and  loss.  Current"
income taxes are determined based on respective taxable income of each taxable entity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between
"the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation"
carry-forwards  and  tax  credits.  Such  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  computed  separately  for  each  taxable
entity. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable income will be available
"against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax"
credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset
to be recovered.
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  based  on  the  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  in  the  period
"when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or"
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on
a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-
forwards can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from interests in joint arrangements are not recognised
if the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

as leases and decommissioning obligations. This amendment is effective from the beginning of comparative period
"presented i.e. April1, 2022. There is a change in Deferred tax component disclosure from net to gross for right to use"
assets and lease liabilities for the Company. There is no impact on opening retained earnings or Profit and loss for the
"year ended March 31, 2024."

31.  Revenue recognition,
(a)  Accounting policy,
,The Company generates revenue principally from-
i),Sale of products - commercial vehicles and vehicle parts.
,The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of
,"variable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products"
,"are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks"
,"and rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably"
,assured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of
,variable  consideration  on  account  of  various  discounts  and  schemes  offered  by  the  Company  as  part  of  the
,contract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis.
,"The  Company  offers  sales  incentives  in  the  form  of  variable  marketing  expense  to  customers,  which  vary"
,depending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for
,as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue
,recognised  when  any  associated  uncertainty  is  subsequently  resolved.  The  Company  estimates  the  expected
,"sales incentive by market and considers uncertainties including competitor pricing, ageing of retailer stock and"
,local market conditions.
,The consideration received in respect of transport arrangements for delivering of vehicles to the customers are
,recognised net of their costs within revenues in the income statement.
ii),Sale of services - maintenance service and extended warranties for commercial vehicles.
,Income from sale of maintenance services and extended warranties are recognised as income over the relevant
,period of service or extended warranty.
,"When the Company sells products that are bundled with maintenance service or extended period of warranty,"
,such services are treated as a separate performance obligation only if the service or warranty is in excess of the
,"standard offerings to the customer. In such cases, the transaction price allocated towards such maintenance"
,service or extended period of warranty based on relative standalone selling price and is recognised as a contract
,liability  until  the  service  obligation  has  been  met.  The  price  that  is  regularly  charged  for  an  item  when  sold
,"separately  is  the  best  evidence  of  its  standalone  selling  price.  In  the  absence  of  such  evidence,  the  primary"
,"method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company"
,estimates  the  cost  of  satisfying  the  performance  obligation  and  then  adds  an  appropriate  margin  based  on
,similar services.
,The Company operates certain customer loyalty programs under which customer is entitled to reward points
,on the spend towards Company’s products. The reward points earned by customers can be redeemed to claim
,discounts on future purchase of certain products or services. Transaction price allocated towards reward points
,granted to customers is recognised as a deferred income liability and transferred to income when customers
,redeem their reward points.
,Sales of services include certain performance obligations that are satisfied over a period of time. Any amount
,received  in  advance  in  respect  of  such  performance  obligations  that  are  satisfied    over  a  period  of  time  is
,recorded as a contract liability and recorded as revenue when service is rendered to customers.
,Refund liabilities comprise of obligation towards customers to pay for discounts and sales incentives.

Government Grants and Incentives
Other  income  includes  export  and  other  recurring  and  non-recurring  incentives  from  Government  (referred  as
“incentives”).
Government  grants  are  recognised  when  there  is  a  reasonable  assurance  that  the  Company  will  comply  with  the
relevant conditions and the grant will be received.
"Government grants are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, either on a systematic basis when the Company"
"recognises, as expenses, the related costs that the grants are intended to compensate or, immediately if the costs"
have  already  been  incurred.  Government  grants  related  to  assets  are  deferred  and  amortised  over  the  useful  life
"of the asset. Government grants related to income are presented as an offset against the related expenditure, and"
government  grants  that  are  awarded  as  incentives  with  no  ongoing  performance  obligations  to  the  Company  are
recognised as income in the period in which the grant is received.

Accounting policy,
,The Company recognises compensation expense relating to share based payments in accordance with Ind AS 102
,Share-based  Payment.  Stock  options  granted  by  the  Company  to  its  employees  are  accounted  as  equity  settled
,"options. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of options granted that is determined on the date of grant, is charged"
,to statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the vesting period of options which is the requisite service
,"period, with a corresponding increase in equity."
,Equity-settled share option plan
(i),Tata Motors Limited Employees Stock Option Scheme 2018
,"The Company has allotted share based incentives to certain employees during the year ended March 31, 2019,"
,under Tata Motors Limited Employee Stock Options Scheme 2018 approved by Nomination and Remuneration
,"Committee (NRC). As per the scheme, the number of shares that will vest is conditional upon certain performance"
,measures determined by NRC. The performance is measured over vesting period of the options granted which
,"ranges from 3 to 5 years. The performance measures under this scheme include growth in sales, earnings and"
,free cash flow. The options granted under this scheme is exercisable by employees till one year from date of its
,vesting. The Company has granted options at an exercise price of ₹345/-. Option granted will vest equally each
,year starting from three years from date of grant up to five years from date of grant. Number of shares that will
,vest range from 0.5 to 1.5 per option granted depending on performance measures.

,,to 2% of the annual basic salary for each year of service. Tata Motors Limited account for superannuation
,,benefits payable in future under the plan based on an actuarial valuation.

"counsel, wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable"

2023) towards rejection of certain statutory forms for concessional lower/nil tax rate on technical grounds and few other
"issues such as late submission, single form issued against different months / quarters dispatches / sales, etc. and denial of"
exemption from tax in absence of proof of export for certain years. The Company has contended that the benefit cannot
"be denied on technicalities, which are being complied with. The matter is pending at various levels."
The  Sales  Tax  authorities  have  denied  input  tax  credit  and  levied  interest  and  penalty  thereon  due  to  varied  reasons
"aggregating to ₹250.43 crores as at March 31, 2024 (₹267.49 crores as at March 31, 2023). The reasons for disallowing"
"credit was mainly due to Taxes not paid by Vendors, incorrect method of calculation of set off as per the department,"
alleging suppression of sales as per the department etc. The matter is contested in appeal.
The Sales Tax authorities have raised demand for Check post/ Entry Tax liability at various states amounting to ₹263.84
"crores as at March 31, 2024 (₹309.47 crores as at March 31, 2023). The Company is contesting this issue."

"amount retrospectively. Pending the directions from the EPFO, the impact for past periods, if any, is not ascertainable"
reliably and consequently no financial effect has been provided for in the financial statements. The Company has complied
"with this on a prospective basis, from the date of the SC order. Also refer note 37 for pension."

41.  Financial instruments,
(a)   Accounting policy,
i),Recognition:
,A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
,equity instrument of another entity.
,Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial
,instruments  are  initially  recognised  when  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of
,the instrument.
,Initial measurement
,Financial  instruments  are  initially  recognised  at  its  fair  value.  Transaction  costs  directly  attributable  to  the
,"acquisition  or  issue  of  financial  instruments  are  recognised  in  determining  the  carrying  amount,  if  it  is  not"
,"classified  as  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  However,  trade  receivables  that  do  not  contain  a  significant"
,financing component are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair
,value through profit or loss are expensed in the statement of profit and loss.
,"Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified."
,Classification and measurement – financial assets
,Classification of financial assets is based on the business model in which the instruments are held as well as the
,characteristics of their contractual cash flows. The business model is based on management’s intentions and
,past pattern of transactions. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when
,determining  whether  their  cash  flows  are  solely  payment  of  principal  and  interest.  The  Company  reclassifies
,financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.
,Financial assets are classified into three categories
,Financial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates
,to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held
,within a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows
,"are classified in this category. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest"
,method less any impairment losses.
,Equity  investments  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (Equity  instruments):  These  include
,financial  assets  that  are  equity  instruments  and  are  designated  as  such  upon  initial  recognition  irrevocably.
,"Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other comprehensive"
,"income, net of applicable income taxes."
,Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss when the right to
,"receive payment has been established. When the equity investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss"
,in equity is transferred to retained earnings.
,Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (Debt instruments): Financial assets having
,"contractual  terms  that  give  rise  on  specified  dates,  to  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and"
,interest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such
,"assets in order to collect such contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial asset, are classified in this"
,"category. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses being recognised in"
,"other comprehensive income apart from any expected credit losses or foreign exchange gains or losses, which"
,are recognised in profit or loss.
,Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit
,and loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial
,recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair
,value through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.
Notes forming part of Financial Statements,
,Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:
,Financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  measured  at  amortised  cost  or  FVTPL.  A  financial  liability  is  classified  as
,"at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it is designated as such on initial recognition."
,"Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense,"
,are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
,effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or
,loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
,"Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured"
,"at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognised less, the cumulative"
,amount of income recognised.
,Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
,Equity instruments:
,An  equity  instrument  is  any  contract  that  evidences  residual  interests  in  the  assets  of  the  Company  after
,"deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received,"
,net of direct issue costs.
ii),Determination of fair value:
,Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
,"between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or"
,estimated using another valuation technique.
,The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the
,consideration given or received).
,"In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset"
,or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability
,at the measurement date.
,"Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted"
,in  active  markets  using  the  quoted  bid  prices  (financial  assets  held)  or  quoted  ask  prices  (financial  liabilities
,held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow
,method and other valuation methods.
,iii)  Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:
,The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
,expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to
,another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
,"and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an"
,associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards
,"of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also"
,recognises  a  collateralised  borrowing  for  the  proceeds  received.  Any  gain  or  loss  arising  on  derecognition  is
,"recognised in profit or loss. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity"
,is transferred to the statement of profit and loss unless it was an equity instrument electively held at fair value
,"through other comprehensive income. In this case, any cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained"
,earnings. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The Company
,reviews the facts and circumstances around each asset before making a determination. Financial assets that are
,written off could still be subject to enforcement activities.
,"Financial liabilities are decrecognised when these are extinguished, that is when the obligation is discharged,"
,cancelled or has expired.
Notes forming part of Financial Statements,
iv),Impairment of financial assets:
,The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on a financial asset that is at amortised
,cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are forward looking and are
,"measured in a way that is unbiased and represents a probability-weighted amount, takes into account the time"
,value  of  money  (values  are  discounted  using  the  applicable  effective  interest  rate)  and  uses  reasonable  and
,supportable information.
v)   Hedge accounting:,
,The  Company  uses  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  its  risks  associated  with  foreign  currency
,fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Company designates these forward contracts
,in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles. The Company also uses interest
,rate swaps to hedge its variability in cash flows from interest payments arising from floating rate liabilities i.e.
,when interests are paid according to benchmark market interest rates.
,"Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair"
,"value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss."
,"At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging"
,"instrument and the hedged item, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are"
,expected to offset changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. The Company documents its risk management
,objective and strategy for undertaking its hedging transactions. The Company designates only the intrinsic value
,of foreign exchange options in the hedging relationship. The Company designates amounts excluding foreign
,currency basis spread in the hedging relationship for both foreign exchange forward contracts and cross- currency
,interest rate swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts that are designated and effective as
,hedges of future cash flows are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive income
,"(net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss."
,Amounts  accumulated  in  equity  are  reclassified  to  the  statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  or  Balance  Sheet  in  the
,periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.
,"For forwards and options, forward premium and the time value are not considered part of the hedge. These are"
,treated as cost of hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other
,comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.
,Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate
,risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.
,"Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or"
,no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of
,profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an adjustment to a non-
,financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These deferred amounts are
,ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of goods
,"sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is"
,retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
,"If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is"
,immediately transferred to the statement of Profit and Loss for the year.

,The  following  table  provides  an  analysis  of  financial  instruments  that  are  measured  subsequent  to  initial,,,,
,"recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below.",,,,
,Quoted  prices  in  an  active  market  (Level  1):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial  instruments  that  are,,,,
,measured  by  reference  to  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities.  This,,,,
,"category consists of quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments.",,,,
,Valuation  techniques  with  observable  inputs  (Level  2):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial  assets  and,,,,
,"liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the",,,,
,"asset or liability, either directly (i.e; as prices) or indirectly (i.e; derived from prices). This level of hierarchy include",,,,
Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.,,,,,
,Valuation  techniques  with  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial,,,,
,assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).,,,,
,"Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither",,,,

Notes forming part of Financial Statements,
(i)   Market risk,
,"Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may"
,result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change
,"as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  interest  rates,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  equity  price  fluctuations,"
,liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with
reasonable accuracy.,
(a),Foreign currency exchange rate risk:
,"The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement,"
,"statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and statement of"
,cash flows where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are
,denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
,"Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations"
,are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily
,"relate  to  fluctuations  in  U.S.  dollar,  Euro  and  GBP  against  the  respective  functional  currencies  of"
,the Company.
,"The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments"
,primarily  to  hedge  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  exposure.  Any  weakening  of  the  functional
,currency may impact the Company’s cost of exports and cost of borrowings and consequently may
,increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.
,The  Company  evaluates  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  by  assessing  its  exposure  to
Notes forming part of Financial Statements,
(b),Interest rate risk
,Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will lead to changes in fair value of financial
,"instruments or changes in interest income, expense and cash flows of the Company."
,The  Company  is  subject  to  variable  interest  rates  on  some  of  its  interest  bearing  liabilities.  The  Company’s
,interest  rate  exposure  is  mainly  related  to  debt  obligations.  The  Company  also  uses  a  mix  of  interest  rate
,sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its day to day operations like
,short term loans.
,"As at March 31, 2024 and 2023, financial liabilities of ₹3,783.43 crores and ₹4,493.80 crores, respectively, were"
,subject to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet
,date would result in decrease/increase in profit before tax of ₹37.83 crores and ₹44.94 crores for the year ended
,"March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively."
,The model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. Although some
,"assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, these may not react correspondingly"
,"to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate"
,"with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may change with a lag."
,The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This
,calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk
,exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average
,debt outstanding during the period.
,"This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant."
,(Note: The impact is indicated on the profit before tax.)
(c),Equity Price risk
,Equity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities.
,The  fair  value  of  some  of  the  Company’s  investments  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive
,income exposes the Company to equity price risks. These investments are subject to changes in the market price
,"of securities. The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as of March 31, 2024 and 2023"
,"was ₹856.59 crores and ₹574.37 crores, respectively. A 10% change in equity price as of March 31, 2024 and 2023"
,"would result in a pre-tax impact of ₹85.66 crores and ₹57.44 crores, respectively."
,"(Note: The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any)."
(ii)  Credit risk,
,Credit  risk  is  the  risk  of  financial  loss  arising  from  counterparty  failure  to  repay  or  service  debt  according  to
,the  contractual  terms  or  obligations.  Credit  risk  encompasses  both  the  direct  risk  of  default  and  the  risk  of
,deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.
,"Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments classified"
,"as fair value through profit and loss, trade receivables, loans and derivative financial instruments. The Company"
,strives to promptly identify and reduce concerns about collection due to a deterioration in the financial conditions
,and others of its main counterparties by regularly monitoring their situation based on their financial condition.
,None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of credit risks.
,Exposure to credit risk
,The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to
,"credit risk was ₹13,378.09 crores and ₹10,346.83 crores as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the"
,"total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, short term deposits with banks, trade receivables, finance"
,"receivables, margin money and other financial assets excluding equity investments."
,Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired
,"None of the Company’s cash equivalents, including short term deposits with banks, are past due or impaired."
,"Regarding  trade  receivables  and  other  receivables,  and  other  loans  or  receivables  that  are  neither  impaired"
,"nor past due, there were no indications as at March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023, that defaults in payment"
,obligations will occur.
